                                <p>As Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, I am pleased to present to Parliament the 2024
                                    Annual Report on Immigration.</p>
                                <p>The vast majority of our labour force growth has been driven by immigration – which remains a
                                    cornerstone of Canada’s economy, cultural diversity and humanitarian leadership.
                                    Canada’s aging population needs newcomers to help address demographic pressures and sustain
                                    our social programs over the long term.</p>
                                <p>We have been through a period of significant change in just a few short years. At the start of the
                                    pandemic, we saw the unprecedented closing of our borders and a halt on the flow of goods and
                                    people.</p>
                                <p>As we emerged from the pandemic, Canada faced severe labour shortages. We took steps and adapted with
                                    new and temporary measures. These actions were necessary to support the urgent needs of businesses
                                    and our economy, to prevent a recession and to help us navigate that challenging period.</p>
                                <p>Today, our economy has evolved, and the landscape is different.</p>
                                <p>Our immigration system has faced growing pressures both within and outside our borders. Multiple
                                    humanitarian crises, rising asylum claims and increased interest in Canada have bumped up against
                                    our own economic demands and community needs.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>These pressures have required us to adapt our immigration levels planning to the current climate. Our annual
                            plans must take into account the capacity to settle, integrate and retain newcomers—which varies across the
                            country—and monitor system-wide pressures in critical sectors such as housing and health care. At the same
                            time, immigrants make significant contributions to the labour market and are part of the solution.</p>
                        <p>What we heard from Canadians is that they expect Canada to identify the right number of newcomers with the
                            needed skills, and help set them up for success.</p>
                        <p>We are adjusting certain immigration streams to better support newcomers and our country’s future.
                            We’ve taken action to address challenges with the international student program, including updating
                            financial requirements for prospective students, establishing a cap on most study permit applications,
                            reforming work options for students and introducing a system to verify letters of acceptance.</p>
                        <p>Thanks to changes to our Express Entry system, we are now better able to prioritize permanent residence
                            applications for critical areas, like trades workers to build more homes and healthcare workers for our
                            hospitals and long-term care.</p>
                        <p>In order to maximize newcomers’ participation in our economy, several provinces and territories are
                            taking steps to improve foreign credential recognition, so more newcomers can work in occupations aligned
                            with their skills and experience. In addition to the Provincial Nominee Program, we have been tailoring our
                            economic immigration streams to support businesses in filling skilled labour shortages in remote, rural and
                            Francophone minority communities.</p>
                        <p>Our humanitarian responses to global events and addressing the needs of vulnerable populations remain a
                            priority. Canada continues to advocate globally for the rights of migrants and refugees by promoting regular
                            pathways and policies that address specific needs. Helping employers access new talent pools, including
                            refugees and other displaced people through the Economic Mobility Pathways Pilot, is an innovative way we
                            are using our immigration system to address labour shortages. Finding these skilled workers among people who
                            happen to be displaced abroad is a made-in-Canada solution that we are promoting globally.</p>
                        <p>Considering the urgency of the global migration crisis, we have been funding temporary housing and services
                            for asylum claimants and increasing our processing capacity as part of our efforts to improve Canada’s
                            asylum system.</p>
                        <p>We have also expanded support for settlement service providers, particularly to advance truth and
                            reconciliation, gender equality and anti-racism. Everyone deserves an equal opportunity for success in
                            Canada.</p>
                        <p>These are just some of the steps we’ve taken to ensure Canada’s immigration system is fast, fair
                            and efficient, which I believe is critical to responding to changes in the immigration landscape.</p>
                        <p>Our 2025 and 2026 immigration levels takes a hard, comprehensive look at our immigration programs –
                            including where tough choices must be made – to reflect the needs of our economy and communities.</p>
                        <p>Our goal has and will always be to preserve the integrity of our programs – for a sustainable and
                            well-managed immigration system.</p>

                    The Annual Report to Parliament on Immigration provides the opportunity to inform Parliament and Canadians of key
                    highlights and related information on immigration to Canada. This Report on immigration and its tabling in
                    Parliament is a requirement of the <a href="https://www.laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/index.html">Immigration and Refugee Protection Act </a>(IRPA), and serves to offer key details on the successes and challenges that have occurred in welcoming
                    immigrants<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> to Canada
                    in the past year.
                    <p>This Report sets out information and statistical details regarding permanent resident admissions, temporary
                        resident volumes, and the immigration levels plan for the upcoming year. In addition, this Report contextualizes
                        the efforts undertaken with provinces and territories in our shared responsibility for immigration, highlights
                        efforts made on Francophone immigration and ends with an analysis of gender and diversity considerations in
                        Canada’s approach to immigration.</p>
                    <h3>About the data in this Report</h3>
                    <p>Admissions data can be found in annexes 1 and 2, as well as on the Government of Canada’s <a href="https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset?_organization_limit=0&amp;organization=cic">Open Government
                            Portal</a>.</p>
                    <p>Data in this Report that was derived from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) operational systems
                        is subject to change.</p>
                    <h2 id="benefits">Balancing the Benefits and the Pressures of Immigration</h2>
                    <p>Immigration has shaped Canada’s economic, political, social, and cultural fabric and has been instrumental in
                        post-pandemic recovery. Except for Indigenous Peoples, who have inhabited these lands since time immemorial,
                        every resident of Canada immigrated here. First generation immigrants comprised 23% of the population in
                        2021.<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup></p>
                    <p>Canada’s approach to immigration focuses on ensuring the country’s long term economic well-being and prosperity,
                        as well as leadership in refugee resettlement. As more Canadians want to move into retirement, immigration
                        brings in new workers, attracts new investments, and supports Canada’s economic growth. At the same time, our
                        immigration framework supports family reunification and offers protection to refugees, while providing
                        flexibility for other humanitarian responses. Temporary residents including visitors, international students,
                        and temporary workers provide contributions to Canada’s social, cultural, and economic landscape. </p>

                                <p>IRCC is committed to developing policies that address the challenges related to border crossing and
                                    migration that Indigenous Peoples separated by Canada’s international borders face on a daily

                                    the complex challenges. The changes also include exploring options to change Canada's right of entry

                            <p>The country is experiencing system-wide pressures across critical sectors, including housing and access
                                to social services. There is also a discrepancy between credential recognition<sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup> and labour market
                                needs in certain regions and economic sectors, which limits the ability of some newcomers to (re)settle

                            <p>Canada is addressing pressures by taking responsible measures to achieve stable growth, announcing an
                                ambitious federal housing plan, and better aligning immigration streams with the labour market. IRCC is
                                also setting up pathways to permanent residence for individuals wishing to establish themselves in
                                Canada and to become citizens, while also balancing the role of temporary workers to sustain the

                            <p>Canada faces demographic challenges due to its aging population. It is projected that between 2024 and
                                2030, 5 million Canadians will retire, causing the worker-to-retiree ratio to decrease to just 3 to

                                causing significant challenges for the Canadian economy.<sup id="fn6-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn6"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>6</a></sup> In 2021, people aged 65 and older
                                accounted for 19% of the total population.<sup id="fn7-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>7</a></sup> The fertility rates, which decreased to a record
                                low of 1.33 children per woman in 2022, are below the population replacement level.<sup id="fn8-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>8</a></sup> Between July 1, 2022
                                and July 1, 2023, nearly 98% of the population growth stemmed from net international migration, while
                                the remaining 2% resulted from the difference between births and deaths.<sup id="fn9-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn9"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>9</a></sup> While not the only
                                solution, immigration could address short-term labour shortages, and attract skills our communities need
                                for the next generation.</p>
                            <p>Immigration is crucial to the country’s future and is key to maximizing Canada’s economic
                                potential. In 2023, Canada welcomed 471,808 immigrants (237,031 females, 234,758 males, 17 another
                                gender and two unspecified) and 58% of whom were admitted under economic streams. Visitors, temporary
                                workers, and international students all contributed to Canada’s economic growth by working,
                                spending, and investing.</p>
                            <p>Maintaining collaborative relationships with provinces and territories is vital to strengthening and
                                improving Canada’s immigration system, which – concurrently with other policy measures
                                – will support the country’s long-term demographic and economic growth.</p>

                    <p>Despite the significant contributions of immigration, successful immigration requires that housing, education,
                        healthcare, childcare services and other key services keep pace with projected population growth. Since 2019,
                        annual targets for new permanent resident admissions have increased by nearly 41% and there has also been an
                        increase in non-permanent resident work permits and study permits.<sup id="fn17-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn17"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>17</a></sup> There was a 125% increase in asylum

                    <p>Canada is in the midst of a housing crisis – highlighted by the insufficient supply of rental units and family
                        homes. In this context, any population growth, which generally necessitates a corresponding increase in housing
                        supply, puts additional strain on the overall supply and affordability of housing.<sup id="fn19-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn19"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>19</a></sup> Canada has experienced a

                        significant peak in immigrant arrivals, the vacancy rate reached a historic low of 1.5%,<sup id="fn21-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn21"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>21</a></sup> especially in big cities

                        <p><strong>Gender Based Analysis Plus (GBA Plus) Impacts: Finding Affordable and Adequate Housing for
                                Immigrants</strong></p>
                        <p>Upon arrival in Canada, many newcomers encounter initial obstacles that hinder their ability to find suitable
                            accommodation, such as restricted access to credit, a lack of Canadian references, and limited familiarity
                            with the local housing landscape. A survey conducted with immigrants in St. John’s, Newfoundland, and
                            Labrador, revealed that 63% of respondents identified “unaffordable housing costs” as a challenge.<sup id="fn23-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn23"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>23</a></sup> </p>
                        <p>Racialized immigrants may be more prone than their Canadian-born counterparts to live in housing that is
                            unaffordable, which is largely attributed to structural inequalities within the labour market. In other
                            words, immigrants from racialized backgrounds earn lower incomes and encounter difficulties with housing
                            affordability. These discrepancies involve lower wage rates, fewer working hours, heightened vulnerability
                            to insecure employment, and a higher incidence of unemployment when compared to their Canada-born
                            counterparts.<sup id="fn24-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn24"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>24</a></sup> Immigrant women face distinct challenges in securing suitable housing in Canada
                            compared to immigrant men or Canadian-born women. Housing also provides access to essential services, such
                            as transportation and education,<sup id="fn25-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn25"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>25</a></sup> meaning that those without adequate housing may
                            struggle to access these systems. In fact, the place where one lives defines the ease of access to these
                            services.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Based on the Canadian Occupational Projection System’s (COPS) extensive labour market information (LMI) data<sup id="fn26-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn26"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>26</a></sup>, the
                        Department expects a shortage of 22,700 workers in the trades category until 2031. This is beyond the number of
                        job seekers coming from school leavers, immigration, and others labour supply needs. In 2023, the Department
                        introduced a trades-specific occupational category for selection in the Express Entry system, as part of
                        category-based selection process. The average annual selection of workers required to meet labour demand needs
                        until year 2031, is approximately 2,520. The two rounds conducted in year 2023 selected 2,500 candidates in
                        total. These rounds, if conducted on an annual basis, could meet the COPS-forecasted labour market demand until
                        2031.</p>
                    <p>IRCC continues to welcome Government Assisted Refugees (GARs) to communities across the country and to shift the
                        relative balance of GAR arrivals from large cities where housing pressures are more significant to small and
                        medium-sized communities experiencing less pressure. In 2023, 12,468 GARs (53%) were destined to small and
                        medium size communities with less than one million residents. </p>

                    <p>Immigrants make contributions to the healthcare sector, representing 1 out of every 4 healthcare workers in this
                        country.<sup id="fn27-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn27"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>27</a></sup> These
                        individuals play critical roles in supporting healthcare for Canadians of all ages and relieving pressure on
                        Canada’s healthcare system. </p>
                    <p>At the same time, newcomers to Canada need access to education and healthcare services. As more people arrive in
                        the country, the need for more health and education services rises. If these services do not keep pace, then the
                        increase in immigration can worsen existing pressure on health and education systems in some regions. </p>
                    <p>IRCC is working to reduce pressures on the healthcare system. In 2023, <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2023/06/category-based-selection---health-workers.html">the
                            Department invited 10,185 workers with work experience in the healthcare field</a> to apply under <a href="https://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/results-by-topic.asp?top=29">Express Entry</a>, one of
                        several key sectors of Canada’s labour force that is facing unprecedented shortages. </p>

                        months to 12 months. The Department has also implemented measures to improve the opportunity for caregivers and
                        their family members in Canada to transition to permanent residence by eliminating the numerical caps for each
                        eligible occupation and by reserving application spaces for caregivers in Canada who have Canadian work
                        experience and for clients with accommodation needs that are unable to apply online. </p>
                    <p> As of April 30, 2024, nearly 5,700 caregivers and their family members have become permanent residents since the
                        launch of the Home Child Care Provider Pilot and the Home Support Worker Pilot in 2019. </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, as of April 2023, physicians who work in a fee-for-service model within the public healthcare
                        system, became exempted from certain requirements of the Federal High Skilled Programs, to facilitate access to
                        permanent residence and help address labour shortages in the healthcare sector.</p>
                    <p>Provinces and territories have primary authority over regulated occupations. Several provinces and territories
                        have taken steps to enhance supports and streamline foreign credential recognition (FCR) processes for
                        internationally educated professionals. The Government of Canada’s role is to coordinate and facilitate
                        stakeholder interaction and supports (loans, funding, federal policies/legislation, etc.) to make it easier for
                        newcomers to obtain credential recognition. As the lead federal department for FCR, Employment and Social
                        Development Canada (ESDC) <a href="/en/employment-social-development/news/2024/01/government-helping-6600-internationally-educated-healthcare-professionals-work-in-canada.html">invested
                            $86 million in 15 projects</a> for the <a href="/en/employment-social-development/programs/foreign-credential-recognition-program.html">Foreign
                            Credential Recognition Program</a> to help provide internationally-educated professionals with the support
                        and experience they need to pursue opportunities in Canada’s healthcare sector. IRCC’s priority is to promote
                        information on FCR to enable potential immigrants and newcomers to make informed choices and start the FCR
                        process as soon as possible. Through the 2022 Federal Economic Statement funding for FCR, IRCC has made
                        investments in the Settlement Program to support those newcomers in health occupations related to language
                        training and employment services. Through the 2024 Settlement Program Call for Proposals, when new funding
                        agreements are in place beginning on April 1, 2025, funding will be allocated to organizations that work with
                        several occupations requiring more supports by the sector, including healthcare professions.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Challenge of Foreign Credential Recognition </strong></p>
                    <p>Census data from 2021 shows that some immigrants’ talents are underutilized, as over one-quarter of all
                        immigrants with foreign degrees were working in jobs that require, at most, a high school diploma. This is
                        double the overqualification rate seen among Canadian-born or Canadian-educated degree holders.<sup id="fn28-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn28"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>28</a></sup> </p>
                    <p>IRCC works closely with provincial and territorial partners, which lead on licensing and credentialing in their
                        areas through their regulatory bodies, to coordinate foreign credential recognition, including in the health
                        sector, and selection processes for immigrants through regional programs and pilots.</p>
                    <p>IRCC uses language testing and Education Credential Assessments (ECA), both essential elements in the FCR
                        process, as evidence of minimum program requirements and for obtaining points in Express Entry. This process
                        differs from FCR processes that regulatory bodies use to authorize practice in regulated occupations. IRCC is
                        looking at ways to align federal economic immigration requirements with licensure processes where possible by
                        advancing the designation, for immigration purposes, of certain domain-specific language tests used by
                        regulators in key sectors, starting with specialized languages tests used for nurses and physicians. The
                        Department is also continuing to actively seek proposals to expand the number of designated professional ECA
                        organizations.</p>
                    <p>Since, in the Express Entry system, more points are given to candidates based on Canadian work experience,
                        Canadian education, and Canadian job offers, this may increase the likelihood of selection of practice-ready
                        professionals. The Department has launched a social media campaign aimed at building awareness of FCR processes
                        for regulated professions in Canada. This builds on informational resources the Department has been providing to
                        prospective permanent residents, including through a letter to Express Entry applicants and a new Fact Sheet on
                        FCR.</p>
                    <p>In June 2023, the Department implemented a temporary public policy granting a select cohort of temporary foreign
                        workers the ability to study without a study permit for a limited time. Foreign nationals coming to Canada to
                        work on a temporary basis cannot currently enroll in a program of study that lasts for more than six months
                        unless they apply for and receive a study permit. This has been a barrier for those who wish to improve their
                        education and get more training, including those needing to up-skill or take programs to validate their foreign
                        credentials in programs that last longer than six months. This is a pilot measure that evaluated the feasibility
                        of allowing temporary foreign workers to study to support expanding their future job prospects and increasing
                        their opportunities to transition to permanent residence. Individuals who held a valid work permit and if the
                        application associated with that work permit was received on or before June 7, 2023, or who have applied for a
                        work permit extension as of that date are eligible to study without a study permit until their work permit
                        renewal application is refused, the expiry of their work permit, or the expiry of the public policy, whichever
                        comes first.</p>
                    <h2 id="tr">Temporary Resident Programs and Volumes</h2>
                    <p>Canada recognizes the importance of temporary immigration, namely the significant social, cultural, and economic
                        benefits that temporary residents can bring to the fabric of our communities. However, limiting the volumes will
                        better serve the country as well as the temporary residents throughout their stay.</p>

                    <!--
<h3>Visitors</h3>
<p>Visitors from most countries require a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV), which allows the holder to travel to Canada for shorter stays. It can be valid for up to 10 years, or until the holder’s passport expires, and can allow multiple entries. </p>

<p>Canada has the unique ability to lift its visa requirement partially or fully. Most non-U.S. visa-exempt foreign nationals require an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) to travel to or through Canada by air. eTAs are valid for up to 5 years (or until the holder’s passport expires) and allow the holder to travel to Canada by air as often as they would like for short stays (typically up to six months). </p>
<p>A partial visa lift, or ‘expanded access to eTA’, allows eligible visitors from countries that do not have a full visa exemption to apply for a light-touch digital eTA instead of a visa to fly to Canada. Known or trusted travellers are those previously screened by either Canada or the U.S., our trusted partner. </p>
<p>This partial visa lift was piloted in Brazil in 2017. In June 2023, Canada <a href="/content/canadasite/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2023/06/eligible-travellers-from-13-more-countries-now-qualify-for-an-electronic-travel-authorization.html">partially lifted visas on select travellers from 13 additional countries</a> : the Seychelles, Morocco, Panama, Costa Rica, Uruguay, Argentina, Trinidad & Tobago, Saint. Kitts and Nevis, Saint. Lucia, Antigua & Barbuda, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Thailand, and the Philippines. </p>
<p>Allowing known or trusted travellers from partially visa-required countries to apply for an eTA instead of a visa makes it faster, easier, and more affordable for them to visit Canada. With this newly streamlined visa process, these countries are expected to bring a significant influx of travel. </p>

                            Foreign Worker Program (TFW)</a> with ESDC, IRCC supports the effective and responsible entry of temporary
                        foreign workers into the Canadian market. The IMP lets employers hire a temporary worker without a Labour Market
                        Impact Assessment (LMIA), while the TFW requires a LMIA in order to hire a temporary worker. Exemptions from the
                        LMIA process are based on the broader economic, cultural or other competitive advantages for Canada and the
                        reciprocal benefits enjoyed by Canadians and permanent residents. The IMP also allows for certain foreign
                        nationals to work without a permit when authorized under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations.</p>

                    <!--Temprorary Foreign Workers Chart here -->
                    <p>Temporary work permit holders continue to transition to permanent residency in recognition of their skills and
                        the contribution they have made to the Canadian economy. The Department has continued to focus on increasing
                        transition opportunities to permanent residence and strengthen Canada’s ability to meet a range of labour needs.
                        In 2023, the Department granted permanent residency to 156,580 temporary work permit holders, a 49% increase
                        from the previous year. Of these work permits issued, 70,767 were female and 85,813 were male. This increase in
                        permanent residencies trends with the overall growth of temporary work permit holders.</p>

                        selection can support economic priorities. Following a public consultation process, the Minister set up six
                        categories designed to support economic growth and help address long-term labour market shortages in communities
                        across Canada, including in Francophone minority communities. Candidates with work experience in occupations
                        eligible under the following categories were invited to apply for permanent residence through category-based
                        selection in 2023: healthcare occupations; science, technology, engineering and math (STEM); trade occupations;
                        transport occupations; agriculture and agri-food occupations. The first use of category-based selection took
                        place in June 2023. In total, there were 17 category-based selection rounds in 2023. </p>

                    <p>Protected persons in Canada (PPIC) may apply for permanent residence in Canada and include in the application
                        their dependents who are in Canada and abroad. PPIC include Convention refugees, persons in need of protection
                        determined by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB), people with positive pre-removal risk
                        assessments, and protected temporary residents. In&nbsp;2023, 23,898&nbsp;obtained permanent residence under the
                        protected persons in Canada and dependents abroad category. From this number, 11,868 were females, 12,026 were
                        males and four were another gender. In 2022, 27,814 obtained permanent residence under the protected persons in
                        Canada and dependents abroad category. It represents a decrease of 14% from 2022 to 2023. In 2023, processing
                        time for the dependents abroad of protected persons was 46 months compared to 42 months in 2022. For the
                        protected persons landed in Canada, the processing time was 25 months compared to 22 months in 2022.</p>
                    <p><strong>Asylum Claims</strong></p>
                    <p>The In-Canada Asylum System is responsible for receiving and registering claims made within Canada, determining
                        eligibility for referral to the IRB, conducting security screenings, providing protection—to persons deemed in
                        need of protection—at or inside Canada’s borders, and removing individuals who are determined not in need of
                        protection. Canada received 143,370 in-Canada asylum claimants in 2023 in different ports of entry and inland
                        offices. This number was 91,710 in 2022. It represents an increase of 56% from 2022 to 2023. During the
                        eight-week period ending in December 2023, 80% of eligibility decisions have been finalized in 77 days or less. </p>
                    <p>As a result of the volume of non-genuine asylum claims originating from Mexico, work began towards a partial
                        reimposition of the visa on Mexican nationals. Since the expansion of the Safe Third Country Agreement in March
                        2023, the number of irregular arrivals has decreased significantly.</p>
                    <p><strong>Successful Settlement and Resettlement Services</strong></p>
                    <p>It is critical to ensure successful, responsive, and locally informed settlement and resettlement services to
                        support integration for newcomers. Through contribution agreements, IRCC funds service provider organizations
                        across Canada (outside Quebec<sup id="fn34-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn34"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>34</a></sup> ), including immigrant-serving agencies and social service organizations to offer a
                        diverse array of settlement services, including but not limited to: aiding newcomers in acquiring knowledge
                        about life and employment in Canada, enhancing their proficiency in official languages, preparing for entry into
                        the job market, fostering meaningful community connections, and building welcoming and inclusive communities. In
                        November 2023, IRCC launched a call for proposals to fund settlement and resettlement service providers over the
                        five-year period from 2025 to 2030. This year’s call highlights key areas, including investments to support
                        truth and reconciliation objectives, broadening the Francophone integration pathway for French speaking
                        newcomers outside Quebec, and enhancing programming to serve racialized communities, 2SLGBTQI+ and other
                        underrepresented people. It will also build on recent advancements by leveraging technology and partnerships to
                        deliver services more efficiently while maintaining high quality support for clients.</p>
                    <p>In 2023, IRCC published its <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/settlement-resettlement-service-provider-information/2023-settlement-outcomes-report.html">Settlement
                            Outcomes Report</a>, summarizing achievements and results from across the settlement sector over the

                        non-clients). Key indicators of success included that most clients (85%) were able to access the Settlement
                        Program with no barriers, and the majority of clients reported that the program was helpful to them on their
                        settlement journey. Generally, clients who accessed settlement services reported greater improvements to their
                        skills than non-clients, for example in the areas of English skills, knowledge of employment-related topics, and
                        knowledge about life in Canada. </p>

                            on Francophone Immigration</a> to enhance the vitality of Francophone minority communities. In 2023, IRCC
                        developed the Policy and, as part of this process, the Department held consultations to understand the
                        perspectives, priorities and challenges faced by Francophone community stakeholders, provinces, and territories,

                        achievement, in 2023, IRCC adopted a new approach to develop its target for French-speaking permanent resident,
                        with annual and progressively increasing target for French-speaking permanent residents outside Quebec
                        integrated into the Multi-Year Levels Plan. The admissions target for 2024 is 6% increasing to 8% by 2026. </p>

                        protection to the world’s most vulnerable populations. Canada not only offers resettlement opportunities but
                        also supports host countries and provides additional pathways for those in need. Furthermore, Canada recognizes
                        and values the contribution that persons who arrive fleeing conflict or other difficult situations make to the
                        country. </p>
                    <p>In March 2023, Canada committed to welcoming 15,000 persons from the Western Hemisphere to continue expanding
                        safe, regular pathways as an alternative to irregular migration. To support delivery of this commitment, on
                        November 17, 2023, IRCC launched a special immigration measure to facilitate the issuance of permanent resident
                        visas to certain <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2023/11/canada-continues-humanitarian-effort-for-people-in-the-americas.html">Colombian,

                        family connections in Canada. The public policy closed in February 2024 when IRCC received enough applications
                        to meet the Department’s commitment. Admissions under this measure began in 2024. </p>

                        building an equitable and inclusive organization. Anti-Racism and GBA Plus continues to be critical components
                        of IRCC’s work. They ensure that the impacts of our policies and programs factor gender, diversity, and many

                        <p><strong>Training under the Atlantic Immigration Program</strong></p>
                        <p>Under the Atlantic Immigration Program, all employers were required to take intercultural competency
                            training, which includes training on how to overcome implicit bias in hiring and managing employees.</p>
                        <p><strong>Corporate Activities at IRCC</strong></p>
                        <p>In 2023, the Department set up an Equity Branch to act as a centre of expertise, providing independent
                            oversight, and employee support services to address racism, discrimination and conflict resolution. Equity
                            Branch will include a new employee Ombuds office to offer a safe, independent, and impartial channel for
                            employees to report and address systemic racism and discrimination in the workplace.</p>
                        <p>Senior executives' performance goals now include equity and anti-racism objectives.</p>
                        <p>IRCC prioritized numerous trainings on Anti-Racism, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, emphasizing inclusive
                            leadership and fostering a respectful workplace. They consulted extensively with designated groups and
                            employee networks to develop diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, gathering feedback through surveys
                            and focus groups. The Department implemented mandatory bias training for all staff, reflecting IRCC's
                            commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive environment.</p>
                        <h3>Inclusion—Initiatives to address inequities and improve inclusion for diverse populations</h3>
                        <p><strong>Giving Opportunities to Caregivers and Their Families</strong></p>

                        <p>In 2023, the amount of <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/caregivers/child-care-home-support-worker.html">work

                        <p><strong>Gathering Information from Stakeholders for Humanitarian Immigration</strong></p>
                        <p>The Department maintains ongoing dialogue with a range of stakeholder groups, including the <a href="https://www.blacklegalactioncentre.ca/">Black Legal Action Centre</a> and <a href="https://migrantrights.ca/">Migrant Rights Network</a>, which advocate for diverse communities.
                            This engagement aims to gain deeper insights into the experiences of migrants. Through this collaborative
                            effort, IRCC can formulate more inclusive public policies that fit to the diverse needs of various
                            populations.</p>
                        <p><strong>Including Gender “X”</strong></p>
                        <p>In 2021, the <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/identity-management/naming-procedures/sex-gender-policy.html">IRCC
                                Sex and Gender Client Identifier Policy</a> was approved to enable individuals who do not identify as
                            female or male to designate “Another Gender - X” for the gender identifier on their passport, travel
                            documents, citizenship certificates, or permanent resident card. “X” aligns with international standards on
                            travel document specifications and stands as the sole alternative to “F” and ’M” for the obligatory sex
                            field in travel documents. IRCC is ensuring the implementation of all aspects of the policy (i.e.,
                            collection, recording and display of sex/gender information) is consistent across program lines.</p>

                        <p>Canada remains committed to promoting a gender-responsive approach to migration in the implementation of the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/migration/global-compact-safe-orderly-and-regular-migration-gcm">Global

                            unified approaches to international migration.
                            For instance, Canada promotes international initiatives such as the <a href="https://gendermigrationhub.org/">Gender + Migration Hub</a>, which develops tools and compiles
                            resources to advance gender equality and the empowerment of women, girls, and LGBTQI+ people on the move; as

                        <p>In 2023–24, IRCC adopted the <a href="https://www.international.gc.ca/transparency-transparence/women-peace-security-femmes-paix-securite/2023-2029-implementation-plans-mise-ceuvre-ircc.aspx?lang=eng#a1">Implementation

                            plan incorporates GBA Plus and inclusion commitments. It also backs the efforts of IRCC to include GBA Plus
                            and gender equality principles into its work, alongside the department's anti-racism pledges. Furthermore,
                            it fosters an understanding of the complex identities and diverse experiences of refugees and individuals in
                            refugee-like situations escaping conflict, aiming to address their needs and priorities more effectively. </p>
                        <p><strong>Improving Access to Permanent Residence and Family Reunification through the Agri-Food Pilot</strong> </p>
                        <p>In 2023, the annual occupational caps were removed to provide an opportunity for more eligible candidates to
                            apply, expanded open work permit access to family members of all principal applicants – regardless of
                            the principal applicant’s job skill level, and allowed unions to attest to a candidate’s work
                            experience in lieu of an employer reference letter.</p>
                        <p><strong>Evaluating Policy and Program Design</strong></p>
                        <p>IRCC has started identifying how to address systemic racism in the Department’s policies and program
                            designs by initiating an evaluation of the Caregiver Program in 2023 which will apply a GBA Plus and
                            anti-racism lens to the assessment of expected outcomes.</p>
                        <p>IRCC has continuously engaged with stakeholders (including client representatives) from the Agri-Food, Home
                            Child Care Provider and Home Support Worker pilots which has enhanced the Department’s ability to
                            employ an intersectional lens when designing, evaluating, and adjusting policies and programs.</p>
                        <p><strong>Including Anti-Racism in Service Delivery</strong></p>
                        <p>IRCC addressed systemic racism by supporting Service Provider Organizations that represent racialized groups,
                            promoting fair human resources practices and embedding Anti-Racism into their organizational culture. In
                            response to the 2023 Office of the Auditor General of Canada audit on Processing Applications for Permanent
                            Residence, IRCC is exploring the impact of voluntary race-based and ethnocultural data on processing times
                            through client surveys. This initiative aims to refine methodologies, uphold data integrity, and strengthen
                            privacy safeguards as part of IRCC's Anti-Racism Strategy.</p>
                        <p><strong>Supporting Policy Design Improvements with Data and Research</strong></p>
                        <p>IRCC has continued to build a robust evidence base for decision making in support of Anti-Racism work by
                            collecting data and completing targeted research and reviews using an intersectional Anti-Racism lens to
                            support policy design improvements. For example, the Department collects disaggregated data on Settlement
                            and Resettlement services providers and clients. Within the Settlement Program, seventeen projects are
                            underway that will enhance IRCC’s ability to identify, examine, and analyze the barriers and obstacles
                            which racialized newcomers face as they settle and integrate into Canadian society. The results of these
                            projects including identified best practices will begin to be available in 2024.</p>

                    <h2 id="annex-2">Annex 2: Temporary Migration Reporting</h2>
                    <h3>Temporary Resident Permits</h3>
                    <p>Under subsection 24(1) of the <em><a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/index.html">Immigration
                                and Refugee Protection Act</a></em> (IRPA), an officer may issue a temporary resident permit (TRP) to a
                        foreign national who is inadmissible or who does not otherwise meet the requirements of the Act, to allow that
                        individual to enter or remain in Canada when it is justified under the circumstances. TRPs are issued for a
                        limited period and are subject to cancellation at any time.</p>
                    <p>Table 1 in Annex 1 illustrates the number of TRPs issued in 2023, categorized according to grounds of
                        inadmissibility under IRPA. In 2023, a total of 7,049 such permits were issued.</p>
                    <h3>Temporary resident permits for victims of human trafficking</h3>
                    <p>TRPs can be issued to out-of-status foreign national victims of human trafficking in Canada as a protection
                        measure. The TRP provides them with temporary resident status in Canada and allows them to obtain a work permit.
                        They also have access to healthcare through the Interim Federal Health Program. In 2023, IRCC issued 125 TRPs to
                        victims of human trafficking and their dependants. This number is included in the overall number of TRPs issued
                        in 2023 (as per Table 1 in Annex 1).</p>
                    <h3>Temporary resident permits for victims of family violence</h3>
                    <p>Since 2019, newcomers experiencing family violence have been able to apply for a fee exempt TRP that gives them
                        legal immigration status in Canada and includes a work permit and healthcare coverage. In 2023, 154 TRPs were
                        approved for victims of family violence.</p>
                    <h3>Public Policy Exemptions for a Temporary Purpose</h3>
                    <p>In 2023, a total of 154 applications for temporary residence were facilitated for foreign nationals to come to
                        Canada as visitors, students and workers, under the public policy to exempt certain foreign nationals from the
                        Inadmissibility Provisions for a Temporary Purpose. This public policy has been in place since September 2010 to
                        advance Canada’s national interests while continuing to ensure to help the safety of Canadians.</p>
                    <h3>Use of the Negative Discretion Authority</h3>
                    <p>In 2023, the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship used once the negative discretion authority under
                        subsection 22.1(1) of IRPA. This authority allows the Minister to make a declaration that, based on public
                        policy considerations, a foreign national may not become a temporary resident for a period of up to three years. </p>
                    <h2 id="annex-3">Annex 3: Ministerial Instructions</h2>
                    <p>The <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/index.html">Immigration and Refugee Protection
                                Act</a></em> (IRPA) provides the legislative authority for Canada’s immigration programs and contains
                        various provisions that allow the Minister to issue instructions to immigration officers to enable the
                        Government of
                        Canada to best achieve its immigration goals. These instructions are typically issued for limited periods of
                        time
                        and can touch on a diverse range of issues.</p>

                    <h2 id="annex-4">Annex 4: Canada’s Next Temporary and Permanent Resident Immigration Levels Plan</h2>
                    <p>Under the <em><a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-2.5/">Immigration and Refugee Protection
                                Act</a></em> (IRPA), the Minister of IRC must table Canada’s Immigration Levels Plan (Levels Plan) in
                        Parliament each year on or before November 1. Since 2017, a rolling three-year Levels Plan has been presented,
                        which
                        projects permanent residents (PR) admissions to Canada. Starting in the fall of 2024, IRCC is expanding the
                        Levels
                        Plan to include targets for both PR admissions and new temporary resident (TR) arrivals. This approach aims to
                        ensure a well-managed migration system by looking at the totality of newcomers, and that supports the economy,
                        while
                        taking into account impacts on housing, health care and other essential services. </p>
                    <p>With a commitment to build a whole-of-society approach to immigration planning, IRCC develops the Levels Plan
                        taking into consideration extensive consultations with federal partners, provinces and territories,
                        municipalities,
                        stakeholder organizations, Indigenous Peoples, and the public, including through regional townhall meetings. </p>
                    <p>PRs are categorized under three overarching groups: Economic immigration; Family reunification; and, Refugees,
                        Protected Persons, Humanitarian and Compassionate, and Other. In recent years, an increasing number of workers
                        and
                        students in Canada have transitioned to PR status, which has shown significant improvement in the labour market
                        and
                        economic outcomes of immigrants, particularly those in high-skilled occupations<sup id="fn54-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn54"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>54</a></sup>. </p>
                    <p>The TR targets introduced for the first time ever in the Levels Plan include new arrivals for international
                        students as well as temporary workers to be admitted under the <a href="/en/employment-social-development/programs/temporary-foreign-worker.html">Temporary

                        of the labour force growth, including for occupations that face persistent structural shortages - such as health
                        care
                        and trades - and for emerging industries which are key to advancing Canada’s goal of a growing and resilient
                        economy. Despite its importance, a recent surge in immigration volumes has resulted in increases in population
                        which
                        has exacerbated existing pressures on services and infrastructure across the country, from housing and health
                        care to
                        education and social supports. Canada’s economy and labour market have also softened, showing higher rates of
                        unemployment for youth and newcomers. The 2025-2027 Levels Plan responds to these pressures and will help ensure
                        that Canadians and newcomers continue to prosper. </p>
                    <h4>Temporary Residents (TRs)</h4>
                    <p>In recognition of recent, rapid population growth and the shifts in Canada’s economic landscape, the Minister of
                        IRC announced in March 2024 the goal to reduce TRs to 5% of the total population by the end of 2026, and a
                        commitment to include TRs in the Levels Plan. In order to achieve this objective and stabilize population
                        growth,
                        while also improving the integrity of Canada’s TR programs, a series of measures across student and temporary
                        worker
                        programs have been introduced throughout the past year. </p>
                    <p>Building on these measures, and taking into consideration those TRs that will transition to permanent residents
                        or
                        leave Canada, the arrival targets for TRs in the 2025-27 Levels Plan are set at 673,650 in 2025, 516,600 in 2026
                        and
                        543,600 in 2027. TR targets will capture new arrivals only, which will provide the number of new workers and
                        students
                        entering Canada each year. In 2025, the target for international students (305,900) decreases by 10% from the
                        2024 <span class="nowrap">target<sup id="fn55-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn55"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>55</a></sup></span> before
                        stabilizing in 2026, while workers, which include arrivals
                        under the IMP and TFW Program, are prioritized accounting for 55% of new TR arrivals in 2025. Targets for the
                        TFW
                        Program prioritize primary agriculture workers in order to protect Canada’s food security and food supply chain.
                        The
                        targets do not include seasonal workers, many of whom also contribute to Canada’s food security, who enter and
                        leave
                        Canada within the same year (e.g., some occupations in Canada for less than 270 days) and are, therefore, not
                        counted in year end population estimates. These worker volumes will be in addition to the number included in the
                        targets. </p>

                    <h4>Permanent Residents (PRs)</h4>
                    <p>To further support the alignment of immigration with labour market needs and to help alleviate the existing
                        pressures
                        on Canada’s domestic systems, the 2025-2027 Levels Plan reduces the overall PR projections set in the <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/notices/supplementary-immigration-levels-2024-2026.html">2024-2026
                            Levels Plan</a> to 395,000 admissions in 2025 and 380,000 for 2026, and sets the target at 365,000 in 2027. </p>
                    <p>The Levels Plan prioritizes the selection of TRs with in-demand work/study experience that want to become PRs,
                        including under the “In-Canada Focus”. It is anticipated that over 40% of overall PR admissions will be TRs
                        already in
                        Canada. This will reduce TR volumes, including the number of new PRs arriving from outside Canada, which will
                        further
                        alleviate the pressure on communities’ capacity to welcome newcomers. </p>
                    <p>Supporting the Canadian economy continues to be a key priority of this Levels Plan as the economic class
                        represents
                        the largest proportion of admissions each year, reaching nearly 62% by 2027. A greater share of economic
                        admissions
                        are allocated to skilled workers with a focus on critical sectors, such as health care and the skilled trades. </p>
                    <p>Although admission targets within the family class are also set to decrease, their share is maintained at a
                        relatively similar to the 2024-26 Levels Plan with a projected 22% of overall PR admissions in order to support
                        family
                        reunification.</p>
                    <p>Canada continues to fulfill its humanitarian commitments to resettle refugees and others in need of protection,
                        with an allocation of 15% of overall PR admissions under this class, in addition to a target of 21,200
                        admissions
                        over three years in support of commitments based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, and/or as part of
                        public
                        policies by the Minister of IRC (e.g., Sudan, Ukraine, and Hong Kong).</p>
                    <p>In line with the Government’s long-term commitment to leverage immigration to enhance the vitality of Francophone
                        minority communities, and IRCC’s <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/francophone-immigration-strategy-2024.html">Policy
                            on Francophone Immigration</a> launched in 2024, the Levels Plan includes gradually increasing targets of
                        French-speaking PR admissions outside of Quebec to 8.5% of overall PR admissions in 2025, 9.5% in 2026 and 10%
                        in
                        2027. This, in turn, will support continued progress towards the demographic growth Francophone minority

                        <li>"NPR Outflow" refers to NPRs leaving Canada, such as through permit expiration or transition to permanent
                            residency. "NPR Inflow" is the net arrival of new NPRs, including workers and students. "Inflows subject to
                            targets set for students and workers" is the target allocation for the net arrival of new study and work
                            permit
                            holders. "Inflows for contingency reserve" serves as a reserve for the residual category including but not
                            limited to asylum claimants. "Net Change in NPRs" is the difference between inflows and outflows. It is the
                            change in total NPR population for each year. "New Permanent Residents" refers to those admitted as PRs,
                            including former NPRs who transitioned to permanent residency. "New PR and NPR in Canada" refers to the
                            total
                            number of new permanent and non-permanent residents admitted to Canada. </li>
