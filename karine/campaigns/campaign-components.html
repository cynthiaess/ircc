                    <h2>Immigrants contribute to the economy and create jobs for Canadians</h2>
                    <p>The strength of Canada’s economy is measured in part by the number of people working (known as the labour force) and paying taxes to fund our public services, such as health care.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to immigration, Canada’s labour force continues to grow every year. While funds for public services are vital, welcoming immigrants is important in helping employers find qualified workers to fill available jobs. This is because Canadians are living longer and having fewer children. More people are retiring, and there are fewer students in schools. As a result, the pool of Canadian-born existing and potential workers is limited.</p>
                    <p>Immigrants contribute to our economy, not only by filling gaps in our labour force and paying taxes, but also by spending money on goods, housing and transportation. </p>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Supporting our aging population</summary>
                        <p>The income tax paid by working Canadians pays for health care, education and other vital services. In 1980, there were roughly 6 workers for every retiree. In 2015, there were 4 workers for every retiree. By 2030, when 5 million Canadians are set to retire, the ratio will be down to only 3 workers for every retiree.</p>
                        <p>Without immigrants to help offset the trends of an aging population, Canada would not be able to offer the same level of services to its residents into the future.</p>
                        <img src="/content/dam/ircc/images/campaigns/stories/facts-graphic1.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">
                        <p>Immigration alone cannot solve this challenge, but it can help as we look to keep our economy growing and maintain our commitments to health care, public pensions and other social programs. More than 80% of the immigrants we’ve admitted in recent years are under 45 years old, meaning they will have plenty of working years in Canada. </p>

                        <p>Some employers are already having trouble finding Canadian-born workers to fill jobs. More than 6 in 10 immigrants are selected for their positive impact on our economy.

                        <p>For immigrants to find work here, it’s important to make sure their education, training and experience meet Canadian job standards. We are working with employers, provinces and territories to make this happen as quickly as possible.</p>
                        <p>Immigrants can also satisfy labour market needs by filling jobs in sectors or positions where employers struggle to find workers.</p>

                        <p>International education is an essential pillar of Canada’s long-term competitiveness. Students from abroad who study in Canada expose Canadians to new cultures and ideas.

If these students choose to immigrate to Canada, they contribute to Canada’s economic success<sup id="fn3-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup>. In 2019, 827,586 international students held study permits in Canada<sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup>, and more than 58,000 former international students immigrated permanently.</p>

                        <p>Immigrants often have a desire for goods from their home country, which broadens the variety of imports available to all Canadian consumers. Immigrants are also able to export more because of their networks in their home countries. </p>
