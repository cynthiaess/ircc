Pages leading to HV,Aug 1_ 2024 - Aug 31_ 2024,The pages with the highest % of visits clicking on the Help Centre link in the footer are the Contact IRCC pages. The content on the Contact IRCC pages is possibly not what users are hoping for (they're likely hoping for a phone number to call)_ leading them to look for help elsewhere_ such as the "Help Centre"_ which has a promising name_ but this ultimately causes them to end up in a loop.
