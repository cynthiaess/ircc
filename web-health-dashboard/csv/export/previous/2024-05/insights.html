<div id="traffic-sources-insights">
    <p><strong>Search engines</strong> (mainly Google) continue to drive most traffic to IRCC content, highlighting the importance of SEO (search engine optimization). </p>
    <p>Of the traffic coming from social networks, nearly half of traffic is referred from <strong>Facebook</strong>. </p>

        <li><strong>Signing in</strong> remains a top task, as 1 in 5 visits includes visiting the secure sign-in landing page.</li>
        <li>Users want to manage their <strong>applications</strong>. Of the topics on the Immigration theme page, over half of the clicks are on the My application link.</li>

        <li><strong>Visitor visa</strong> is clearly the most popular Visit program receiving nearly 3/4 of the doormat clicks.</li>

        <li><strong>Express Entry</strong> remains the most popular immigration program, receiving 1/3 of the doormat clicks on the Immigrate topic page.</li>

        <li> Unsurprisingly, nearly half of doormat clicks on the Get a work permit page are for regular work permits for <strong>temporary workers</strong>.</li>

<!-- TSS -->
<div id="tss-insights">
    <p>Overall scores for task success, ease, and satisfaction remain <strong>stable</strong> compared to last month.</p>
    <p>The following 3 tasks got task success scores <strong>above 80%</strong>: Check processing times, Apply for a work permit, and Apply for an eTA.</p>
    <p>The program content for <strong>PR cards</strong> clearly needs improvement as the PR card task has the lowest scores in all 3 areas: task success, ease, and satisfaction.</p>
</div>

<!-- Contact & Helpcentre -->
<div id="contact-hc-insights">
    <h4 class="mrgn-tp-0">Contact us</h4>
    <p>The pages with the highest % of visits clicking on the Contact Us link in the footer are the <strong>Passport Help Centre</strong> and the <strong>Client Support Centre services</strong> page.</p>

    <p>(Note that the Contact Us link from the Passport Help Centre is contextualized and sends users to the Contact the Passport Program page.)</p>


    <h4>Help centre</h4>
    <p>The pages with the highest % of visits clicking on the Help Centre link in the footer are the <strong>Contact IRCC pages</strong>. The content on the Contact IRCC pages is possibly not what users are hoping for (they're likely hoping for a phone number to call), leading them to look for help elsewhere, such as the "Help Centre", which has a promising name, but this ultimately causes them to end up in a loop.</p>
