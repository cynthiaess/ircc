<h1>How do I unlink or separate family or group applications?</h1>

    <p>How you unlink applications within a family or group depends on your application. We review and decide on requests to unlink applications on a case-by-case basis.</p>
        
    <h2>Citizenship applications (grants of citizenship)</h2>
    <h3>You applied for citizenship online</h3>
    <details>
      <summary>If you haven't submitted your group's applications yet</summary>
      <p>Follow our <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/apply/online-group.html#leave-remove">instructions to leave or remove someone from the group</a>.</p>

        <summary>If there's a problem with one of the applications in your family or group</summary>
          <p>We may separate your family's applications if someone in your group needs to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=361&amp;top=5">re-write the written test</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=366&amp;top=5">attend a hearing with a citizenship officer or a citizenship judge</a></li>
            </ul>
          <p>If we do separate the applications, we’ll continue to process the other family members’ applications. This might mean they will attend an earlier citizenship ceremony and become citizens faster than the one re-writing the test or attending the interview.</p>
          <p>We'll tell you before we separate your family's applications. We'll also send you a form you can use to ask us to process the applications together.</p> 
          <p><strong>If you want the applications processed together</strong>, we'll pause the other applications until after the second test or interview. If citizenship is then granted, all family members will attend the same ceremony.</p>
      </details>
    
    <h2>All other citizenship-related applications</h2>
    <p>This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>proof of citizenship (citizenship certificates)</li>
        <li>search of citizenship records</li>
        <li>renouncing your Canadian citizenship</li>
        <li>resuming your Canadian citizenship</li>
      </ul>
