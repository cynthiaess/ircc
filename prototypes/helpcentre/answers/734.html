<h1>How do I unlink or separate family or group citizenship applications?</h1>

    <p>How you unlink applications within a family or group depends on your application. We review and decide on requests to unlink applications on a case-by-case basis.</p>
    
    <h2>Citizenship applications (grants of citizenship)</h2>
    <h3>You applied for citizenship online</h3>
    <details>
      <summary>If you haven't submitted your group's applications yet</summary>
      <p>Follow our <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/apply/online-group.html#leave-remove">instructions to leave or remove someone from the group</a>.</p>

            <p>This includes people who applied to become Canadian citizens and are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) members</li>
                  <li>adopted children born outside Canada</li>
                  <li>stateless people born to Canadian parents</li>
                </ul>
            
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>If there's a problem with one of the applications in your family or group</summary>
          <p>We may separate your family's applications if one of the applications in your group gets delayed.</p>
          <p>If we do separate the applications, we’ll continue to process the other family members’ applications. This might mean the person whose application is delayed will attend a different citizenship ceremony and become a citizen on a different day from the rest of the group.</p>
          <p>We'll tell you before we separate your family's applications. We'll also send you a form you can use to ask us to process the applications together.</p> 
          <p><strong>If you want the applications processed together</strong>, we'll pause the other applications until all applications are ready to be finalized. If citizenship is then granted, all family members will attend the same ceremony.</p>
