Prepared for a third round of usability testing, to be completed during the Federal Budget blackout.</li>
                                <li>Created prototypes of all IRCC partner accounts (GCKey-using accounts) in the new sign-in pattern. Reviewed and revised text to accommodate the needs of each account. </li>
                                <li>Developed a prototype of the super visa content in the subway pattern. Collapsed the super visa-specific IRCC Portal landing page with the one for visitor visas. This starts the process of reducing redundancy across TR programs that point to the Portal. </li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>Made evidence- and best practice-based recommendations for improvements </li>
                                <li>Worked closely with advisors to validate our findings, refine our recommendations to maximize feasibility, and adapted our timelines to the urgency of the project </li>

                                <li>We learned that our process is very adaptable – we were able to adapt to a wide variety of deadlines and web advisor needs</li>
                                <li> We also experimented with different kinds of reports – our first ultra-condensed report was fully contained within Figma, saving us time by not formally creating a slide deck </li>
                                <li>We accepted that the relationship with program-area clients is pivotal to success. Without their trust and buy-in, even the most thorough evidence-based report could be rejected if seen as too forceful, or overbearing. We worked closely with advisors to make the handoff from WURD, to advisors, to the program client smoother than ever. </li>
