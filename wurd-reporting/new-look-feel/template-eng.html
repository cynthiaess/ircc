            <p> The team gained a lot of maturity during this quarter, and we showed that our user-centered methods are highly successful.</p>

                                    <li>improved the Work branch by adding a few questions to provide a shorter, more tailored list of programs to clients</li>
                                    <li>further reduced the large number of results by condensing several program streams into one result for the over-arching program </li>
                                    <li>developed an additional branch for people seeking asylum or refugee status (pending client approval)</li>

                            <li>Launched the revised and improved “account chooser” page for studying in Canada, to help users identify their account, based on what they applied for </li>
                            <li>Re-imagined and redesigned the IRCC account wizard, to help users get back to their account, for any program with an online application. Completed a second round of usability testing, identified remaining usability issues and updated the design to fix them. Prepared for a third round of usability testing, to be completed during the Federal Budget blackout.</li>
                            <li>Created prototypes of all IRCC partner accounts (GCKey-using accounts) in the new sign-in pattern. Reviewed and revised text to accommodate the needs of each account. </li>
                            <li>Developed a prototype of the super visa content in the subway pattern. Collapsed the super visa-specific IRCC Portal landing page with the one for visitor visas. This starts the process of reducing redundancy across TR programs that point to the Portal. </li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Share IRCC partner account prototypes with the Web team and launch the new design pattern. </li>

                                    <li>support the development of the new client platform for IRCC</li>
                                    <li>coordinate the integration of this new platform into the existing IRCC website</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Provided support and advice to the design team in preparation for release 2. Helped pull content from applications expected to be launched in the system.</li>
                            <li>Drafted changes required to the IRCC site for release 1. Liaised with web advisors to validate and approve changes. </li>
                            <li>Developed prototypes for the CXP launch, showing how users will be directed to the system, including integration in content and a new landing page. </li>
                            <li>Participated in usability testing for the account name. </li>
                            <li>Provided guidance and rationale on the account name to senior management in DPM. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Next steps</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stage and launch site updates for CXP release 1 </li>
                            <li>Continue providing support and advice on platform and content development for release 2 </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>What we learned</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Clients don’t remember the name of their account. But given the existing account ecosystem, our recommendation was to use a name that stands separate from the other ones, with the end goal being no name at all. </li>
                            <li> More applications continue to go through the secure account than the IRCC Portal (which is where we direct clients in our content). Unless we stop new applications from being started in the legacy systems, we’ll have a hard time transitioning exclusively to the IRCC Portal – New version.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Worked closely with advisors to validate our findings, refine our recommendations to maximize feasibility, and adapted our timelines to the urgency of the project </li>
                            <li>We tailored our deliverables to suit the needs of each advisor/client relationship <ul>
                                    <li>E.g. Study was under rushed timelines, so we modified our report to be shorter and more direct, delivering as soon as possible </li>
                                    <li>IEC had a unique advisor/client relationship, so we modified our usual presentation approach to help maintain a smooth relationship between all parties </li>

                            </li>

                        <h4>What we learned:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We learned that our process is very adaptable – we were able to adapt to a wide variety of deadlines and web advisor needs</li>
                            <li> We also experimented with different kinds of reports – our first ultra-condensed report was fully contained within Figma, saving us time by not formally creating a slide deck </li>
                            <li>We accepted that the relationship with program-area clients is pivotal to success. Without their trust and buy-in, even the most thorough evidence-based report could be rejected if seen as too forceful, or overbearing. We worked closely with advisors to make the handoff from WURD, to advisors, to the program client smoother than ever. </li>
