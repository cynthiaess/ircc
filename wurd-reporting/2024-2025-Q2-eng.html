                                <ul> <li>Monitored user activity and feedback after launch</li></ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The majority of our clients continue to use the IRCC secure account to apply, even if it&rsquo;s not the account we tell them to use in program content.</li>
                            <li>Clients often want to start with account creation, rather than going through program content, and were looking for the language to match.</li>
                            <li>Clients just want to sign in and don&rsquo;t understand why we can&rsquo;t simplify to that. They don&rsquo;t understand the multiple account situation and how it complicates their experience.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>After checking the progress of WURD’s recommendations, we decided to improve how we work with advisors with the goal of making implementing our recommendations easier for them. </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Mapped out all recommendations from previous research reports made by WURD </li>
                    <li>Brainstormed questions to ask advisors on how to improve our ways of working and interacting with them </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Send out a survey to advisors, and conduct interviews with advisors we have worked with, as well as those we are yet to work with. </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>There are a lot of factors that affect how quickly advisors can fully implement recommendations. Understanding these factors can make our work with them smoother and more pleasant </li>
                    <li>Getting anonymous feedback from advisors might lead to useful feedback that they might not be comfortable sharing directly with us </li>
                    <li>There is still room for improvement in the way we work with advisors and deliver our services </li>
