                <p>If you’re not invited to apply within 12&nbsp;months of submitting your Express Entry profile, it will automatically expire. You can see this date in&nbsp;your account.</p>
<p>When your profile expires, it will be removed from the system. You will get a message in your account.</p>
<p>You can still create a new profile. If your profile is about to expire, you can print out screen shots of your profile to make it easier to re-enter your data.</p>
<p>Don’t create a new profile until your existing profile expires. If you do, you’ll need to&nbsp;withdraw your existing profile&nbsp;first.</p>
<p>To withdraw your profile:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/content/canadasite/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account.html">Sign in to your account</a></li>
<li>Go to “View the applications you submitted” on the main page</li>

</ol>
<p>If you don’t submit a new profile, you can’t mention Express Entry in your profiles on any job boards.</p>
<p>If you submit a new profile, you’ll get a new:</p>

                <summary>If you decline your invitation to apply</summary>
                <p>If you decline an invitation, you'll be put back into the Express Entry pool of candidates. You'll be considered in future rounds of invitations, <a href="#centred-popup" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">if you’re still eligible</a>.</p>
<p>The cut-off score varies from round to round. If your score isn’t high enough, you might not be invited to apply again. In some cases, you may have to take steps to be invited to apply again. For example, you may need to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="4-profile.html#wait">improve your score</a></li>
<li>update your Express Entry profile</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no guarantee that you'll be invited to apply again. However, if you choose to re-enter the pool, declining an invitation <strong>won't</strong> affect whether or not you’re invited to apply later.</p>
<p>If you <strong>don't</strong> decline an invitation and you <strong>don't apply within 60 days</strong>, the invitation will expire and your profile will be removed from the pool. To be considered in future rounds of invitations you'll have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>fill out and submit a new Express Entry profile</li>
<li>meet the eligibility</li>
<li>be accepted into the pool again</li>
</ul>

                <p>If your situation (or that of your spouse or common-law partner) changes, you should <a href="https://ircc.canada.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp">re-calculate your score</a> before applying online for permanent residence.</p>
<p>If your recalculated score is less than the <a href="5-rounds.html">lowest score in your round of invitations</a>, you should decline the invitation. If you decide to apply anyway, we may:</p>
<ul>
<li>refuse your application</li>
<li>not refund your application fee</li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples of changes that could lower your score:</p>
<ul>
<li>you no longer have a <a href="2c-job-offer.html">valid job offer</a></li>
<li>you no longer have a provincial nomination</li>
<li>your language test scores:<ul>
<li>have expired</li>

                <summary>If your work permit expires soon</summary>
                <p>If your work permit expires before you submit your application and you didn’t apply for a new one yet, it may cause your score to drop.</p>
<p>This could happen if you got <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/offer-employment.html">points for a job offer</a> but the work permit associated with the job offer expired before you submitted your application. This could cause you to not be eligible anymore.</p>
<p><strong>If your score has dropped below the minimum cut-off for your round of invitations, you should decline the invitation.</strong> If you submit your application anyway, we’ll refuse it.</p>
<p>If you decline, you’ll be put back in the pool. You should <a href="https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1005&amp;top=29">update your Express Entry profile</a> to show the change in your work status.</p>

                        <p>A certified photocopy is a photocopy of an original document that is readable and certified as a true copy of the original by an authorized person.</p>
                        <p>The authorized person compares the documents and marks on the photocopy:</p>
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Check with your provincial or territorial authorities to be sure who can certify your documents.</p>
                        <p><strong>Outside Canada,</strong> each country has different authorities to certify documents. A notary public may be able to certify your documents, but you should check with your local authorities to be sure.</p>
