<h2 id="biometrics">Get your fingerprints and photo (biometrics) taken</h2>
<p>If you’re between 14 and 79 years old, you need to give your fingerprints and photo (biometrics) for every permanent residence application you submit. You need to do this even if you gave your biometrics in the past and they’re still valid.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In most cases, you must pay the&nbsp;<a href="#biometric-fee" aria-controls="biometric-fee" class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" role="button">biometric fee</a> <strong>when you submit your application</strong>. Otherwise, you may have delays.</li>
  <li>If your application is complete, we’ll send you a letter confirming you need to give your biometrics.</li>
  <li>If you haven’t already paid your biometrics fee, pay it <strong>as soon as you get the letter</strong> from us.</li>
  <li>You have <strong>30 days</strong> from the date on the letter to give your biometrics.</li>
</ul>
