        <h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Police certificates</h1>
        <p>You must include police certificates when you apply for permanent residence.</p>

        <h2 class="h3">On this page</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="#who">Who needs police certificates</a></li>
        <li><a href="#get">Get the police certificates you need</a></li>
        <li><a href="#in-time">If you can't get a police certificate in time</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="who">Who needs police certificates</h2>
        

<p>Our online system will ask for a police certificate for:</p>
<ul>
<li>you and <a href="/content/canadasite/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#family_members">your family members</a> who are 18 years or older</li>
<li class="list-unstyled"><strong>and</strong></li>
<li>every country you (or a family member) stayed in during the last 10 years for <strong>6 months in a row or longer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You <strong>don’t</strong> need to give us police certificates for any period of time before you were 18 years old or for time spent in Canada.</p>
<p>After you apply, an officer may ask for additional police certificates from any time in your life since you were 18 years old.</p>

<h3>Examples of when you don’t need a police certificate</h3>
 <details>
    <summary>Example A: 8-month stay before age 18 </summary>
    <p>Juan is 24&nbsp;years old the day he applies for permanent residence. He lived in the United States for 8&nbsp;months when he was 16&nbsp;years old.</p>
    <p>The system will <strong>not</strong> ask him for a police certificate from the United States.</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Example B: 7-month stay 20 years ago</summary>
    <p>Feras is 45&nbsp;years old. He worked in Turkey for 7&nbsp;months when he was 25&nbsp;years old.</p>
    <p>The system will <strong>not</strong> ask him for a police certificate from Turkey.</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Example C: Several short stays in another country</summary>
    <p>Lailah studied in Spain between 2014 and 2017, for several 4-month study periods but she did not stay there for 6 months <strong>in a row</strong> or longer.</p>
        <p>The system will <strong>not</strong> ask for a police certificate, but an officer <Strong>may</Strong> ask for one from Spain after she submits her application. To avoid delays, Lailah could ask for a police certificate from Spain and submit it with her application.</p>
</details>

<h3>Why we ask for police certificates</h3>
<p>If you have a criminal record, you may not be allowed to enter or stay in Canada. People who pose a risk to Canada’s security are also not allowed to come to Canada.</p>

<h2 id="get">Get the police certificates you need</h2>
<p>It can take a long time to get police certificates. You should consider asking for them as soon as your profile is in the pool.</p>
<p><a href="/content/canadasite/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/police-certificates/how.html" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg mrgn-bttm-md">Find out how to get a police certificate</a></p>

<details>
<summary>If you need a request letter</summary>
<p>Some countries will only give you a police certificate if you have a request letter from us. If this applies to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload a document in the police certificate field in the document checklist that says: “I am applying from a country that requires an official request letter from IRCC to get a police certificate”.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll then review your application. <strong>If it is otherwise complete</strong>, we’ll send you more information on how to get a police certificate.</p>
</details>

<h3>Submit scanned copies of the original certificates</h3>
<p>Police certificates must be scanned copies of the original certificate(s) in colour. Certified true copies or unauthorized copies won’t be accepted and will result in your application being rejected.</p>

<h3>When the certificate must be issued</h3>
<details>
<summary>For the country where you currently live</summary>
<p>The police certificate for the country where you currently live must be issued no more than <strong>6&nbsp;months before</strong> the date you <strong>submit</strong> your application.</p>
<p>Since processing times vary, we may ask you for updated police certificates.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>For any other country</summary>

<p>For any other country, the police certificate must be issued <strong>after</strong> the last time you stayed there for <strong>6&nbsp;months in a row or longer</strong>.</p>
<p>Some countries put <strong>expiry dates</strong> on their police certificates. If you have a police certificate that expired, include it. We’ll accept it&nbsp;if:</p>
<ul>
<li>it was issued <strong>after</strong> the last time you stayed there for <strong>6&nbsp;months in a row or longer</strong></li>
<li>it is <strong>not</strong> for the country where you currently live</li>
</ul>
<p>We may ask for updated documents at any time during processing.</p>
</details>

<h2 id="in-time">If you can't get a police certificate in time</h2>
<p>If you’re invited to apply, you have <strong>60 days</strong> to submit your application for permanent residence.</p>
<p>If you do not have all your police certificates by the 60-day deadline, you can provide:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a letter of explanation, <Strong>and</Strong></li>
    <li>proof that shows you made your best effort to get a police certificate on time
        <ul>
            <li><Strong>Examples of proof include</Strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>a confirmation receipt</li>
                    <li>a payment receipt</li>
                    <li>a delivery notice</li>
                    <li>a tracking number</li>
                    <li>an explanation from the agency that issues the certificate showing why there is a delay or why it can’t be issued</li>
                  </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>You can upload your letter of explanation and proof in the country-specific police certificate field of your document checklist.</p>

<p>An officer will review your application. If they’re not satisfied that you made your best effort, your application may be rejected for being incomplete.</p>
