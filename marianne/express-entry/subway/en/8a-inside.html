            <ul>
                <li><a href="#confirm">confirm your permanent resident status</a></li>

            </ul>


            <h2 id="confirm">Confirm your permanent resident status</h2>
            <p>In most cases, we can confirm <a href="/content/canadasite/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card/understand-pr-status.html">permanent resident (PR) status</a>:
                <ul>
                    <li>through a secure online portal</li>
                    <li>without in-person interviews</li>
                </ul>
<p><strong>You don’t have to do anything</strong> until we contact you using the email or phone number you provided.</p>
<p>You’ll get emails from a mailbox ending in <strong>cic.gc.ca</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>asking you to confirm your email address</li>
  <li>asking you to confirm you’re physically in Canada</li>
  <li>giving you information about the Permanent Residence (PR) Portal (and options if you can’t use it)</li>
</ul>
<p>The portal is separate from your IRCC secure account. <strong>Don’t create your own account</strong> in the PR Portal as this can delay the process. We’ll create an account for you. Follow the instructions in the email we send you.</p>
<p><a href="/content/canadasite/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/pr-confirmation-portal.html">How to confirm your status in the PR Portal</a></p>
<p>You <strong>must</strong> tell us if you leave Canada before we grant you permanent resident status.</p>

            <h2 id="pr-card">Get a permanent resident card</h2>
            <p>Once you become a permanent resident, we’ll make an <Strong>electronic confirmation of permanent residence (e-COPR)</Strong> available to you in the PR Portal so that you can provide proof of your new status in Canada.</p>
            <p>In this portal, we’ll also ask you to provide a photo so we can start the process of issuing your first <a href="/content/canadasite/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card.html">permanent resident (PR) card</a>. <Strong>You don’t need to apply</Strong> for your first PR card. We'll mail your PR card to the Canadian address you provided in your application.</p>
<p>While you wait for your PR card, you can use your printed and signed e-COPR to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>prove you’re a permanent resident in Canada</li>
  <li>apply for government benefits and services for which you’re eligible (for example, to apply for your&nbsp;<a href="/content/canadasite/en/employment-social-development/services/sin.html">social insurance number</a>&nbsp;so you can work)</li>
</ul>
