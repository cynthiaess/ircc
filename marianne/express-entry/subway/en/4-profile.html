            <h2 id="pool">How the pools work</h2>
            <p>If you want to come to Canada as a skilled immigrant, your first step is to create your profile and submit it to the Express Entry pool.</p>
            <p>If you’re eligible, we’ll:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>place you in a pool with others who are also eligible</li>
            <li>give you a score and rank you using several factors</li>
            <li>invite you to apply to be a permanent resident of Canada (if you’re one of the top candidates)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Completing an online Express Entry profile or entering the pool <strong>doesn’t</strong> guarantee that we’ll invite you to apply for permanent residence. You can only apply if we send you <strong>an invitation</strong>.</p>

            <h2 id="create">Create your profile</h2>
<ol>
    <li><a href="/content/canadasite/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents.html">Prepare your documents</a>.</li>
    <li>Sign in to your IRCC secure account.</li>
    <li>Enter your personal reference code when it prompts you (if you used the Come to Canada tool).</li>
    <li>Enter your personal details to create a profile.
        <ul>
            <li>You may exit the profile at any time. Your information will be saved in your account.</li>
            <li>You won’t be asked to enter information about your dependent children. We’ll only ask you for this information if you’re invited to apply.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Submit your profile.
        <ul>
            <li>You have <strong>60 days</strong> to complete and submit your Express Entry profile. Otherwise, you’ll have to start again.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Based on the information you enter, we’ll figure out which program(s) you’re eligible for and may be invited to apply to.</li>
</ol>           


<details>
    <summary>If you’re eligible for more than one program</summary>
    <p>If you're eligible for more than one program through Express Entry, you'll be invited to apply for the first program you meet <Strong>in this order</Strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Canadian Experience Class (CEC),</li>
        <li>Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), then</li>
        <li>Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><Strong>You can’t choose</Strong> which program you are invited to apply for. The system will sort profiles based on the information you enter.</p>
    <p>If you decline the invitation, the system will not re-invite you under the next program. You will go back in the pool, and if we invite you again, the same order will apply.</p>

            <h2 id="rank">How we rank your profile</h2>
<p>You get points based on the information in your profile, including your skills and experience.</p>
<p>To be chosen from the pool and invited to apply, you need to have one of the <strong>highest-ranking scores</strong> when we send out invitations. If you are invited, you can apply for permanent residence.</p>
<p>The Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) is the points-based system we use to assess and score your profile and rank you in the Express Entry pool.</p>

<h2 id="update">Keep your profile up-to-date</h2>
<p>You must update your profile if your situation changes, for example, if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>start a new career</li>
<li>gain or lose a job offer</li>
<li>get a new language test</li>
<li>get married or divorced</li>
<li>have or adopt a new child</li>
</ul>
<p>If we find that you gave us false information or left out important details, we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>refuse your application</li>
<li>find you inadmissible</li>
<li>bar you for 5 years from applying to come to Canada</li>
</ul>

<details><summary><h3 class="h4">Common reasons why your profile may become ineligible</h3></summary>
<ul>
	<li>Your work experience no longer meets the program requirements.
		<ul>
			<li>For example, it needs to be in the 3 years before you apply, and it no longer is due to your time in the pool.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Your language test results expired.</li>
	<li>Your educational credential assessment (ECA) results expired.</li>
	<li>You no longer have enough funds.</li>
	<li>You changed your primary occupation.</li>
