<p>If you have a <strong>new</strong> job offer (offer of arranged employment), you need to update your Express Entry profile in&nbsp;<a href="/content/canadasite/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account.html">your IRCC secure account</a> with the:</p>

    <p>Under the policy, your job offer:</p>

<h2 id="lmia">Who needs an LMIA</h2>

<p><strong>Your future employer is responsible for getting you an LMIA if you need one.</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>you don't already have a work permit</li>
    <li>your work permit has expired</li>
    <li>you’re working on an open work permit</li>
    <li>you have a job offer from an employer not listed on your work permit</li>

<p>There are&nbsp;<strong>only 2 reasons</strong>&nbsp;the employer making you the offer <strong>doesn’t</strong>&nbsp;need to get a new LMIA:</p>
<ol>
    <li>if you’ve already been working full-time (or an equal amount of part-time) for them with a work permit based on an LMIA, and you have a valid job offer</li>
