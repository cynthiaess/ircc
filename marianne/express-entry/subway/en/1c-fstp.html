<h2>Skilled trade sectors</h2>
<p>Skilled trades need specialized knowledge and hands-on work. You’ll need an apprenticeship for most trades. </p>
<p>Skilled tradespeople may work in sectors such as:
<ul>
    <li>construction</li>
    <li>transportation</li>
    <li>manufacturing and industrial</li>
    <li>natural resources and agriculture</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="work">Skilled trades work experience</h2>
<p>First, find out the National Occupational Classification (NOC) for your job. Then check if it meets the requirements for skilled work experience. </p>
<p><a href="/content/canadasite/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/find-national-occupation-code.html" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg mrgn-bttm-md">Find your NOC</a></p>

    <li>a certificate of qualification in your skilled trade issued by a Canadian provincial, territorial or federal authority</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="certificate">Certificate of qualification</h3>
<p>A certificate of qualification (or a qualification certificate) proves you’re qualified to work in a certain skilled trade in Canada. This means you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>passed a certification exam</li>
    <li>meet all the requirements to practise your trade in the province or territory that issued your certificate</li>
</ul>
<p>This certificate is issued by:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#provinces">the provincial or territorial body that governs trades in their province or territory</a>, or</li>
    <li><a href="#federal">a federal authority</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To get a certificate, the provincial, territorial or federal authority must assess your training, trade experience and skills to decide if you’re eligible to write a certification exam.</p>
