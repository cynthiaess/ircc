</ul>


<h2 id="what">What is an ECA</h2>
<p>An Educational credential assessment (ECA) is used to verify that your foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.</p>
<p>There are different types of ECAs. You need to get an ECA <strong>for immigration purposes</strong>. If you got another type of ECA, you may be able to get it re-issued, depending on the type of ECA and/or issuing organization.</p>
<p>You must include your ECA report and the reference number in your Express Entry profile.</p>
<p>Your ECA report may help when you’re looking for a job, but it <strong>doesn’t</strong> guarantee that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you’ll get a job in your field, or at a certain level</li>
  <li>you’ll get a <a href="/content/canadasite/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/who-can-apply/federal-skilled-trades.html#certificate">license to practice</a> in a <a href="/content/canadasite/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#regulated_occupation">regulated profession</a> (job)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you plan to work in a regulated job, you must <a href="/content/canadasite/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/prepare-life-canada/prepare-work/credential-assessment.html">get your license in the province or territory</a>&nbsp;that you plan to settle in.</p>

<h2 id="who">Who needs an ECA</h2>
<p>If you completed your education <strong>outside Canada</strong>, you need an Educational credential assessment (ECA) to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>be eligible as the principal applicant for Federal Skilled Workers Program (Express Entry), <strong>or</strong></li>
  <li>earn points for education you got outside Canada</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also earn points for your spouse or common-law partner’s education, if they are coming with you to Canada.</p>
<p>You <strong>don’t</strong> need an assessment for a <strong>Canadian</strong> degree, diploma or certificate.</p>
<p>To earn points, your report must show that your completed foreign credential (degree, diploma or certificate) is <strong>equal to a completed</strong> Canadian <a href="/content/canadasite/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#school">secondary school</a>&nbsp;(high school) or&nbsp;<a href="/content/canadasite/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#post_secondary_institution">post-secondary</a>&nbsp;credential.</p>

<h2 id="get">Get an ECA</h2>
<h3>Which credentials to get assessed</h3>
<p>In most cases, you only need an assessment for your <strong>highest level of education</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a Master’s degree, you only need an assessment for that degree. You don’t need one for your Bachelor’s degree.</p>

<details>
  <summary>When to get an assessment for 2 or more credentials</summary>
  <p>To get points for having 2 or more credentials, you need an assessment for<strong> each one</strong>.</p>
  <p>To get full points for more than 1 credential, at least 1 of the credentials must be for 3 or more years of study.</p>
  <p>The order that you complete your credentials does not affect points.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>When to get your secondary education assessed</summary>
  <p>If your post-secondary credential is not equal to a Canadian credential, you could get your secondary credential assessed. This would get you points for completing secondary school.</p>
</details>

<h3>Who can do your assessment</h3>
<p>You must get your assessment from an organization or a professional body designated by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada. They will give you a report that tells you what your education is equal to in Canada.</p>
<p>Processing times and costs may vary by organization or professional body.</p>
<p>Once you choose a designated organization or a professional body, they will tell you how to submit your documents to get your assessment.</p>

    <p>This is also known as First professional degree or Entry-to-practice professional degree.</p>
    <p>For Express Entry, <strong>only</strong> degrees in these fields can earn equal points to a Master’s degree:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>medicine</li>
      <li>veterinary medicine</li>
      <li>dentistry</li>
      <li>podiatry</li>
      <li>optometry</li>
      <li>law</li>
      <li>chiropractic medicine</li>
      <li>pharmacy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, a 4-year nursing degree is not considered a first professional degree. It would earn you the same number of points as a Bachelor’s degree.</p>
