            <h2 id="what">What is an ECA</h2>
            <p>An Educational credential assessment (ECA) is used to verify that your foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.</p>
            <p>There are different types of ECAs. You need to get an ECA <strong>for immigration purposes</strong>. If you got another type of ECA, you may be able to get it re-issued, depending on the type of ECA and/or issuing organization.</p>
            <p>You must include your ECA report and the reference number in your Express Entry profile.</p>
            <p>Your ECA report may help when you’re looking for a job, but it <strong>doesn’t</strong> guarantee that:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>you’ll get a job in your field, or at a certain level</li>
            <li>you’ll get a <a href="1c-fstp.html#certificate">license to practice</a> in a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#regulated_occupation">regulated profession</a> (job)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you plan to work in a regulated job, you must <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/prepare-life-canada/prepare-work/credential-assessment.html">get your license in the province or territory</a>&nbsp;that you plan to settle in.</p>
            
            <h2 id="who">Who needs an ECA</h2>
            <p>If you completed your education <strong>outside Canada</strong>, you need an Educational credential assessment (ECA) to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>be eligible as the principal applicant for Federal Skilled Workers Program (Express Entry), <strong>or</strong></li>
            <li>earn points for education you got outside Canada</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also earn points for your spouse or common-law partner’s education, if they are coming with you to Canada.</p>
            <p>You <strong>don’t</strong> need an assessment for a Canadian degree, diploma or certificate.</p>
            <p>To earn points, your report must show that your completed foreign credential (degree, diploma or certificate) is <strong>equal to a completed</strong> Canadian <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#school">secondary school</a>&nbsp;(high school) or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#post_secondary_institution">post-secondary</a>&nbsp;credential.</p>

            <h2 id="get">Get an ECA</h2>
            <h3>Which credentials to get assessed</h3>
            <p>In most cases, you only need an assessment for your <strong>highest level of education</strong>.</p>
            <p>For example, if you have a Master’s degree, you only need an assessment for that degree. You don’t need one for your Bachelor’s degree.</p>
            
            <details>
                <summary>When to get an assessment for 2 or more credentials</summary>
                <p>To get points for having 2 or more credentials, you need an assessment for each one.</p>
                <p>To get full points for more than 1 credential, at least 1 of the credentials must be for 3 or more years of study.</p>
                <p>The order that you complete your credentials does not affect points.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>When to get your secondary education assessed</summary>
                <p>If your post-secondary credential is not equal to a Canadian credential, you could get your secondary credential assessed. This would get you points for completing secondary school.</p>
            </details>

<h4>Choosing a designated organization based on your occupation</h4>
<p>If you plan to work for a large employer or in a regulated occupation, you may need to have your assessment done by a specific designated organization. Check with your employer or the <a href="https://www.cicic.ca/935/find_an_occupational_profile.canada?search=&amp;cat=1" rel="external">regulatory body for your occupation</a> for more information.</p>


<h4 id="professional">Designated professional bodies for physicians and pharmacists</h4>
<details>
    <summary><h5>Specialists and family physicians (NOC 31100, NOC 31101 or NOC 31102)</h5></summary>
<p>You must get an ECA report for your <strong>primary medical diploma</strong> from the <a href="http://mcc.ca/repository/educational-credential-assessment/" rel="external">Medical Council of Canada</a> if your <a href="https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1007&amp;top=29">primary occupation</a> is:</p>
<ul>
<li>specialist in clinical and laboratory medicine (NOC code 31100)</li>
<li>specialist in surgery (NOC code 31101)</li>
<li>general practitioner or family physician (NOC code 31102)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Medical Council of Canada is a professional body for doctors designated on April 17, 2013. If you have a different primary occupation, another designated organization can do your assessment.</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary><h5>Pharmacists (NOC 31120)</h5></summary>
<p>The <a href="http://www.pebc.ca/index.php/ci_id/3374/la_id/1.htm" rel="external">Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada</a> (professional body for pharmacists designated on January 6, 2014) must do your assessment if:</p>
<ul>
<li>your primary occupation is pharmacist (NOC code 31120)</li>
<li>you need a license to practise</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you would need a license if you were caring for patients in a:</p>
<ul>
<li>community pharmacy</li>
<li>hospital pharmacy</li>
<li>long-term care facility</li>
<li>other practice settings</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re in a position where you don’t need a license, one of the other designated organizations can assess your credentials. For example, you may not need a license to work in the pharmaceutical industry or in a government job where you need a pharmacy degree for the job, but don’t need a license to practice pharmacy.</p>
<p>Contact the <a href="https://www.cicic.ca/938/pharmacists.canada?id=50" rel="external">regulatory body</a> in the province where you plan to live to find out if you need a licence to practice your intended occupation.</p>

    <p>This is also known as First professional degree or Entry-to-practice professional degree.</p>
    <p>For Express Entry, <strong>only</strong> degrees in these fields can earn equal points to a Master’s degree:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>medicine</li>
      <li>veterinary medicine</li>
      <li>dentistry</li>
      <li>podiatry</li>
      <li>optometry</li>
      <li>law</li>
      <li>chiropractic medicine</li>
      <li>pharmacy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, a 4-year nursing degree is not considered a first professional degree. It would earn you the same number of points as a Bachelor’s degree.</p>
