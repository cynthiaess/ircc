      <p>Your family members may need to include a provincial attestation letter from the province or territory where they plan to study with their study permit application. This applies to new study permit applications received on or after January 22, 2024.</p>
       <p>Not everyone needs a provincial attestation letter. For example, those who are applying to study in a preschool, primary school or secondary school (up to grade 12) don’t need a provincial attestation letter</p>

  <p><strong>Our permanent residence fees have increased</strong></p>
  <p>The fees for all permanent residence applications increased on April&nbsp;30, 2024. If you paid your fees before April&nbsp;30, but have not yet submitted your complete application, you will need to <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/pr-fees-increase.html">pay the difference</a>.</p>
  </div>
  
  
    <p>In most cases, your fees include</p>
    <ul>
      <li>processing fees for you and anyone you include on your application for permanent residence</li>
      <li>the <a href="https://ircc.canada.ca/english/information/fees/fees.asp#rprf">Right of Permanent Residence Fee</a> (RPRF)</li>

      <p>If your family members are applying for visitor visas, study permits or work permits with your application, you need to pay fees for those too.</p>
    </details>
    <p>When you finish, you must save each receipt and upload all of your receipts with your online application.</p>
    <p>You have to <a href="https://ircc.canada.ca/english/information/fees/index.asp">pay your fees online</a>.</p>
  
    <h4>Biometrics</h4>
    <p>You and your family members may need to give your fingerprints and photograph (biometric information) at a biometric collection service point.</p>
    <p>In most cases, you must pay a biometrics fee <strong>when you submit your application</strong>. Otherwise you may experience delays. The biometrics fee covers the cost of collecting fingerprints and a digital photo.</p>
    <p>After you pay the biometrics fee with a complete application, we’ll send you a letter to tell how and where to give your biometrics. You&nbsp;<strong>must show this letter</strong>&nbsp;when you give your biometrics. Get this done <strong>as soon as you get the letter</strong> from us.</p>
    <p>You must give your biometrics in person. You should book an appointment.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Submit your online application</h3>
    <p>Before you submit your application, make sure you</p>
    <ul>
      <li>use the&nbsp;<a href="/content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/kits/forms/imm5981e.pdf">Document Checklist – Home Child Care Provider and Home Support Worker [IMM 5981]&nbsp;(PDF, 3.39&nbsp;MB)</a>&nbsp;so you don’t forget anything</li>
      <li>answer all questions</li>
      <li>sign any forms that needs to be signed by hand</li>
      <li>include all of your payment receipts</li>
      <li>upload all the supporting documents</li>
      <li>digitally sign your application (type your full name exactly as shown on your passport)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your application is incomplete, we’ll reject it. You’ll have to fix any errors and then re-submit it, as long as the cap hasn’t already been reached. If you don’t request a refund or use your fees for another immigration program, you may be able to use the same receipt when you resubmit your application. Before you use the same receipt, make sure the fees are <strong>both</strong> complete and have not changed since you last applied. </p>
